            Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Arinze. I'm a Senior Software Developer passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world industrial challenges. My work centers on using software, AI, and machine learning to build intelligent systems that solve complex problemsâ€”from smart manufacturing to quantum computing.

  , where I applied Grammatical Evolution to synthesise executable quantum circuits from scratch. A key breakthrough came when I evolved a 3-qubit Groverâ€™s algorithm circuit that outperformed canonical implementationsâ€”achieving over 90% reductions in depth and gate count while improving fidelity on real IBM quantum hardware. It was a clear moment where I saw theory, experimentation, and innovation converge.
